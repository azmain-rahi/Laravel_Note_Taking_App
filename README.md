Here I made a simple note taking app with laravel. Here I used the default login and registration from of laravel. Please let me know if you want a custom registration and login form. I have implemented user authentication such as user registration, login, and logout functionalities, ensuring secure authentication for accessing user-specific notes. In this app we can create, edit and delete notes and each note have a title, content, creation date, and last modified date. I implemented CRUD operations for managing notes. I added search functionality. By using this feature user can find notes based on titles or content. I used the given template for designing the user interface.
